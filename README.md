## **This is the Seattle Solver's code for the FLL 2022-23 season, Superpowered.**
- This [Github Respiratory]('https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/about-repositories') is designed to help organize code for the Robot game and for version control.
- Simply create a [pull request]('https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests') to add a new work or modify/remove unnecessary files.
- All of the code<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup> is an ```.lmsp``` format, and is not available for online view (at least to my extent). As a result, you must download the  [Ev3 Classroom App](https://education.lego.com/en-us/downloads/mindstorms-ev3/software) if you already haven't, and then download the files that you want.
