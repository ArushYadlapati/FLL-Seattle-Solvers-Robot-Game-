## **This is the Seattle Solver's code for the FLL 2022-23 season, Superpowered.**
- This [Github Respiratory]('https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/about-repositories') is designed to help organize code with version control for the Robot Game, and the Innovation Project App.
- Simply create a [pull request]('https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests') to add a new work or modify/remove unnecessary files.
- All of the robot game code<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup> is an ```.lmsp``` format, and is not available for online view (at least to my extent). As a result, you must download the  [Ev3 Classroom App](https://education.lego.com/en-us/downloads/mindstorms-ev3/software) if you already haven't, and then download the files that you want. To actually open the file, make sure the Ev3 Classroom App is CLOSED. If it's not, it won't open the file. This is true for opening files when other files are open on the Ev3 Classroom App as well.
- All of the innovation project app code is in ```Kotlin```, with the UI made with ```Extensible Markup Language``` made with Android Studio. The code for our blinds app is is in a [seperate github epository](https://github.com/Vision1nil/SmartBlinds-App).
