## **This is the Seattle Solver's code for the FLL 2022-23 season, Superpowered.**
- This [Github Respiratory]('https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/about-repositories') is designed to help organize code for the Robot game and for version control.
- Simply create a [pull request]('https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests') to add a new work or modify/remove unnecessary files.
- All of the code<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup> is an ```.lmsp``` format, and is not available for online view (at least to my extent). As a result, you must download the  [Ev3 Classroom App](https://education.lego.com/en-us/downloads/mindstorms-ev3/software) if you already haven't, and then download the files that you want.

Members, please be responsible and no screwing around. If you don't know how something works, either don't touch it or Google it up. Your choice.

This [Github Respiratory]('https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/about-repositories') used to be set to private (to prevent security breaches and just me being panaroid), but now is set to public for ease of access.
